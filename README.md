# Accountable

An Elixir package to deal with a lot of the account related boilerplate such as creating users, authenticating, authorizing and such. All so you can get to the juicy parts faster, hacking on your domain logic.

My goal is to keep `Accountable` as modular as possible, so that you can get up and running in no time, and piece by piece replacing parts with your own implementations as your application grows more complicated.

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `accountable` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:accountable, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at [https://hexdocs.pm/accountable](https://hexdocs.pm/accountable).
